My take:

1) some people may have changed their vote while queueing
2) PAP can reach only 75%, 1/4 of locals would vote for whatever but not, never the PAP.
So candidates performance must be gauged on how near to that value they are.

How do good brands handle a crisis?

- Don't take three days and issue multiple press releases. Get the face of the brand, its leader and the alleged offender in front of the media immediately.

- Don't be defensive. Address the allegations and apologise.

我国大选上周五（7月10日）落幕，人民行动党蝉联执政，但得票率下降，盛港集选区也被工人党夺下。大选后，一些房地产买家关心的或许是大选结果对楼市的影响，包括位于盛港集选区的房地产价格是否会出现显著变化，政府又是否会针对大选结果调整房地产政策。对此，受访分析师表示，大选结果对楼市影响微乎其微，政府并不会以大选结果为考量而调整房地产政策，哪个政党管理哪个区，更不会直接影响到该区房价。
